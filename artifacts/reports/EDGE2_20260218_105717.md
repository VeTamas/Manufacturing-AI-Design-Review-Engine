# CNC Design Review + DFM Report

## Input summary

- Manufacturing process: EXTRUSION

- Material: Aluminum
- Production volume: Production
- Load type: Static
- Tolerance criticality: Medium

- Part size: Medium
- Min internal radius: Medium
- Min wall thickness: Medium
- Hole depth class: None
- Pocket aspect class: OK
- Feature variety: Low
- Accessibility risk: Low
- Has clamping faces: True


## Process recommendation

- Primary: **EXTRUSION**

- Secondary: CNC

- Less suitable (given current inputs): AM, CASTING, FORGING, MIM

- Not applicable (hard gated): INJECTION_MOLDING (polymer process), THERMOFORMING (polymer process), COMPRESSION_MOLDING (polymer process)

- Tradeoffs:

  - Tooling lead time vs unit cost: IM/Sheet metal need tooling; CNC/AM suit low volume.

  - Tolerance and finish: Define critical interfaces; plan post-machining or inspection where needed.

  - Risk drivers: Warpage (IM/AM), supports (AM), setups (CNC/Sheet metal) affect feasibility.

  - Volume sensitivity: IM and sheet metal favor production runs; CNC/AM suit proto and small batch.

  - Documentation: 2D drawing and scale confirmation improve tolerance and process selection.

## Agent confidence & limitations

- **Score:** 0.62

- **High confidence:** Material specified as Aluminum.; Volume indicated as Production and load as Static.

- **Medium confidence:** Part-level qualitative attributes (size, wall, pocket, access) suggest basic manufacturability.

- **Low confidence:** DFM conclusions lack numeric validation due to missing CAD metrics.; Absence of tooling, tolerance, and shop constraints increases uncertainty.

- **Limitations:** numeric CAD metrics; detailed manufacturing tolerances; tooling and machine constraints; external RAG evidence

- **To improve:** Run CAD metric extraction on EDGE2.STEP and supply measured values (wall thicknesses, min radii, hole depths).; Provide numeric tolerances for critical features or upload 2D drawings with tolerances.; Specify tooling and machine constraints (available cutters, spindle limits, fixture/clamping details).
