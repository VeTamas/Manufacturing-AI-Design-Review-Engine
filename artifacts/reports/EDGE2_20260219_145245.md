# CNC Design Review + DFM Report

## Input summary

- Manufacturing process: AUTO

- Material: Steel
- Production volume: Small batch
- Load type: Static
- Tolerance criticality: Medium

- Part size: Medium
- Min internal radius: Medium
- Min wall thickness: Medium
- Hole depth class: None
- Pocket aspect class: OK
- Feature variety: Low
- Accessibility risk: Low
- Has clamping faces: True


## Process recommendation

- Primary: **CNC**

- Secondary: CNC, EXTRUSION

- Less suitable (given current inputs): AM, CASTING, FORGING, MIM

- Not applicable (hard gated): INJECTION_MOLDING (polymer process), THERMOFORMING (polymer process), COMPRESSION_MOLDING (polymer process)

- Tradeoffs:

  - Tooling lead time vs unit cost: IM/Sheet metal need tooling; CNC/AM suit low volume.

  - Tolerance and finish: Define critical interfaces; plan post-machining or inspection where needed.

  - Risk drivers: Warpage (IM/AM), supports (AM), setups (CNC/Sheet metal) affect feasibility.

  - Volume sensitivity: IM and sheet metal favor production runs; CNC/AM suit proto and small batch.

  - Documentation: 2D drawing and scale confirmation improve tolerance and process selection.

## Top priorities

- [MEDIUM] Consider EXTRUSION + CNC finishing (HYBRID_EXTR1)

- [MEDIUM] Steel extrusion supplier availability / cost risk (EXTR_STEEL1)

- [LOW] Low feature variety (favorable for cycle time and tooling) (PASS1)



## Findings (HIGH)

- **Low volume + MIM (tooling ROI risk)** (MIM1) — MIM has high upfront tooling cost; unit cost only becomes favorable at production volumes.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; MIM best for stable designs at production scale.

## Findings (MEDIUM)

- **Low volume + casting (tooling risk)** (CAST1) — Casting has significant tooling cost; economics favor production runs.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; casting best at production scale.
- **Low volume + forging (tooling risk)** (FORG1) — Forging has significant die cost; economics favor production runs.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; forging best at production scale.
- **Consider EXTRUSION + CNC finishing** (HYBRID_EXTR1) — Geometry indicates extrusion-friendly profile. Secondary CNC for cut-to-length, drilling, tapping, and milling improves fit and interface quality.
  - Recommendation: Primary: CNC for precision and flexibility. Secondary: EXTRUSION for near-net shape and economics. Design for hybrid manufacturing: use extrusion for base profile, CNC for critical features.
- **Steel extrusion supplier availability / cost risk** (EXTR_STEEL1) — Steel extrusion is less common than aluminum; fewer suppliers and higher cost/lead-time risk, depending on alloy and profile.
  - Recommendation: Confirm alloy, required tolerances, and supplier capability early; consider aluminum extrusion or CNC-from-bar as alternatives if supplier risk is high.

## Findings (LOW)

- **Low feature variety (favorable for cycle time and tooling)** (PASS1) — Low complexity reduces cycle time and tooling risk.
  - Recommendation: No change needed.
- **Low accessibility risk (good tool access)** (PASS2) — Good tool access reduces setup and machining risk.
  - Recommendation: No change needed.

## Action Checklist

- [ ] Address HIGH and MEDIUM findings before release.
- [ ] Apply recommended design changes for critical features.
- [ ] Re-verify tolerances and interfaces after changes.
