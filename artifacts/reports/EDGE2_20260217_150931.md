## Process recommendation

- Primary: **CNC**

- Secondary: None

- Less suitable (given current inputs): AM, CASTING, FORGING, EXTRUSION, MIM

- Not applicable (hard gated): INJECTION_MOLDING (polymer process), THERMOFORMING (polymer process), COMPRESSION_MOLDING (polymer process)

- Tradeoffs:

  - Tooling lead time vs unit cost: IM/Sheet metal need tooling; CNC/AM suit low volume.

  - Tolerance and finish: Define critical interfaces; plan post-machining or inspection where needed.

  - Risk drivers: Warpage (IM/AM), supports (AM), setups (CNC/Sheet metal) affect feasibility.

  - Volume sensitivity: IM and sheet metal favor production runs; CNC/AM suit proto and small batch.

  - Documentation: 2D drawing and scale confirmation improve tolerance and process selection.



## Manufacturing confidence inputs

- CAD uploaded: yes

- CAD analysis status: none

- CAD evidence used in rules: no

- CAD Lite analysis: ok

- Extrusion Lite analysis: ok

_Confidence inputs not provided._



## Top priorities

- [LOW] Low feature variety (favorable for cycle time and tooling) (PASS1)

- [LOW] Low accessibility risk (good tool access) (PASS2)



## Findings (HIGH)

- **Low volume + MIM (tooling ROI risk)** (MIM1) — MIM has high upfront tooling cost; unit cost only becomes favorable at production volumes.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; MIM best for stable designs at production scale.

## Findings (MEDIUM)

- **Low volume + casting (tooling risk)** (CAST1) — Casting has significant tooling cost; economics favor production runs.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; casting best at production scale.
- **Low volume + forging (tooling risk)** (FORG1) — Forging has significant die cost; economics favor production runs.
  - Recommendation: Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; forging best at production scale.

## Findings (LOW)

- **Low feature variety (favorable for cycle time and tooling)** (PASS1) — Low complexity reduces cycle time and tooling risk.
  - Recommendation: No change needed.
- **Low accessibility risk (good tool access)** (PASS2) — Good tool access reduces setup and machining risk.
  - Recommendation: No change needed.

## Action Checklist

- [ ] Address high-risk MIM route: Low volume + MIM (tooling ROI risk): Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; MIM best for stable designs at production scale.
- [ ] Define inspection and validation plan per Tolerance criticality: Medium — identify critical dimensions, select inspection methods, and run a prototype to validate fit and static-load performance.
- [ ] Address medium-risk forging route: Low volume + forging (tooling risk): Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; forging best at production scale.
- [ ] Address medium-risk casting route: Low volume + casting (tooling risk): Consider CNC or AM for low volumes; casting best at production scale.
- [ ] Verify Retain favorable design aspects: Low feature variety (favorable for cycle time and tooling): No change needed; Low accessibility risk (good tool access): No change needed. Keep geometry to minimize fixturing and CAM complexity.
- [ ] Verify Produce supplier quotes and lead-time comparison for CNC vs AM in steel, including fixture/tooling costs and per-piece pricing; prioritize suppliers experienced with static-load steel parts.

## Assumptions

- Exact production quantity not specified beyond "Small batch"; decisions assume low-volume production.
- No CAD, explicit dimensions, or numeric tolerances were provided; actions assume geometry is known to the engineering team.
- Supplier capabilities, lead times, and cost targets are not provided and must be confirmed during quoting.
- Surface finish, heat treatment, and secondary-process requirements are unspecified and assumed to be determined during process selection.

## Agent confidence & limitations

- **Score:** 0.55

- **High confidence:** Low feature variety reduces cycle time and tooling complexity.; Low accessibility risk indicates good tool access per CNC tool-access RAG.

- **Medium confidence:** Low-volume production favors CNC or AM over MIM/forging/casting for ROI.; Recommendations to obtain CNC vs AM quotes are appropriate but need supplier validation.

- **Low confidence:** Exact process selection, cost, and lead-time comparisons due to missing supplier data.; Inspection scope and critical-dimension validation without numeric tolerances or detailed CAD metrics.

- **Limitations:** numeric CAD metrics unavailable; numeric tolerances missing; no 2D drawing; exact production quantity unknown

- **To improve:** Run numeric CAD analysis on EDGE2.STEP to extract critical dimensions, wall thicknesses, and part mass.; Provide 2D drawings with numeric tolerances or GD&T for all critical features.; Confirm target production quantity range and expected annual volume.
