# CNC Design Review + DFM Report

## Input summary

- Manufacturing process: EXTRUSION

- Material: Aluminum
- Production volume: Production
- Load type: Static
- Tolerance criticality: Medium

- Part size: Medium
- Min internal radius: Medium
- Min wall thickness: Medium
- Hole depth class: None
- Pocket aspect class: OK
- Feature variety: Low
- Accessibility risk: Low
- Has clamping faces: True


## Process recommendation

- Primary: **EXTRUSION**

- Secondary: CNC

- Less suitable (given current inputs): AM, CASTING, FORGING, MIM

- Not applicable (hard gated): INJECTION_MOLDING (polymer process), THERMOFORMING (polymer process), COMPRESSION_MOLDING (polymer process)

- Tradeoffs:

  - Tooling lead time vs unit cost: IM/Sheet metal need tooling; CNC/AM suit low volume.

  - Tolerance and finish: Define critical interfaces; plan post-machining or inspection where needed.

  - Risk drivers: Warpage (IM/AM), supports (AM), setups (CNC/Sheet metal) affect feasibility.

  - Volume sensitivity: IM and sheet metal favor production runs; CNC/AM suit proto and small batch.

  - Documentation: 2D drawing and scale confirmation improve tolerance and process selection.

## Top priorities

- [MEDIUM] Consider EXTRUSION + CNC finishing (HYBRID_EXTR1)



## Findings (HIGH)

_None_

## Findings (MEDIUM)

- **Consider EXTRUSION + CNC finishing** (HYBRID_EXTR1) — Geometry indicates extrusion-friendly profile. Secondary CNC for cut-to-length, drilling, tapping, and milling improves fit and interface quality.
  - Recommendation: Primary: EXTRUSION for near-net shape and economics. Secondary: CNC for cut-to-length, drilling, tapping, and milling. Design for finishing: define machining datums and leave stock only where needed.

## Findings (LOW)

_None_

## Action Checklist

- [ ] Confirm Produce an inspection and process-control plan targeted at CNC-finished features consistent with medium tolerance criticality, including final inspection points and first-article verification.
- [ ] Consider EXTRUSION + CNC finishing: Primary: EXTRUSION for near-net shape and economics. Secondary: CNC for cut-to-length, drilling, tapping, and milling.
- [ ] Address Mark and call out machining datums on the drawing and explicitly indicate stock allowances where CNC will finish features.
- [ ] Confirm Create a process routing: extrusion → cut‑to‑length → CNC operations (drilling, tapping, milling); assign operations to specific setups and list required fixturing.
- [ ] Define part orientation and datum faces for each CNC setup to ensure tooling access and reduce number of setups.
- [ ] Verify extrusion supplier capabilities (profile complexity, maximum billet length, available alloys) and adjust the extrusion profile to avoid features that would require complex secondary forming.

## Assumptions

- Material is Aluminum (from job context).
- Production volume is Production (from job context); prioritize cost-effective, repeatable processes.
- Load type is Static (from job context); no dynamic fatigue design drivers assumed.
- Tolerance criticality is Medium (from job context); tighter tolerances will be achieved on machined datums only.

## Agent confidence & limitations

- **Score:** 0.64

- **High confidence:** Extrusion + CNC is appropriate for aluminum, production volumes; Callout of machining datums and stock allowances is required

- **Medium confidence:** Recommended process routing (extrusion → cut‑to‑length → CNC); Need to verify extrusion profile complexity against supplier capabilities

- **Low confidence:** Exact machining datums and stock amounts without numeric CAD analysis; Fixturing and setup count predictions

- **Limitations:** numeric tolerances absent; no 2D drawing with datums; no measured CAD metrics; shop tooling and fixture details unavailable

- **To improve:** Run numeric CAD analysis to extract critical dimensions, stock allowances, and feature depths from EDGE2.STEP; Add explicit numeric tolerances and datum callouts on 2D drawings derived from the CAD; Produce 2D fabrication drawings that mark machining datums and indicate where stock remains for CNC finishing
