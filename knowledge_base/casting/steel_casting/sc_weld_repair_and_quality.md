# Steel Casting Quality and Repair Considerations

## Practical Reality

- Weld repair may be part of production workflow
- Heat input can affect properties
- Inspection strategy must match criticality

## Design Implications

- Identify critical structural regions early
- Plan inspection approach

## Agent Heuristics

- Structural critical part without inspection plan → HIGH risk
- Geometry prone to defects + strict no-repair requirement → HIGH risk
