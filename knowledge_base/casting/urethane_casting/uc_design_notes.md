# Urethane Casting Design Notes

## Geometry

- Draft helps demolding
- Thin fragile features risk tearing
- Large flat areas may warp

## Inserts

- Inserts possible but require planning
- Threads often post-machined

## Agent Heuristics

- No draft + complex geometry → HIGH risk
- Large flat panels without stiffening → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
