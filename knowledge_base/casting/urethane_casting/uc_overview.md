# Urethane Casting Overview

Often used for prototype and small-batch plastic-like parts.

## Advantages

- Faster than injection molding tooling
- Good cosmetic quality
- Useful bridge process

## Limitations

- Mechanical properties vary
- Long-term stability must be validated

## Agent Heuristics

- Low volume injection molding candidate → consider urethane casting
- Tight tolerance without machining plan → HIGH risk
