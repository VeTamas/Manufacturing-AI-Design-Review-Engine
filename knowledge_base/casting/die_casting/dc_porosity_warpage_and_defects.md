# Die Casting: Porosity, Warpage, and Defects

Geometry strongly influences casting defects.

## Typical Defects

- Porosity from gas or shrinkage
- Warpage from uneven cooling
- Flash at parting lines
- Misruns from poor flow

## Geometry Drivers

- Thick sections promote hot spots
- Long thin features risk incomplete fill
- Abrupt transitions increase distortion

## Mitigation Approaches

- Core thick regions
- Use ribs for stiffness
- Smooth thickness transitions

## Agent Heuristics

- Large thickness gradients → HIGH risk
- Thin extremities + large part → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Cosmetic requirement without defect strategy → MEDIUM risk
