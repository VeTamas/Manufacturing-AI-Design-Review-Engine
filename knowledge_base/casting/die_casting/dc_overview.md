# Die Casting: Process Overview and When It Fits

Die casting is typically used for high-volume metal parts requiring good repeatability, surface finish, and relatively thin sections.

## When Die Casting Fits

- Stable product design with production volumes
- Parts benefiting from thin walls and complex geometry
- When tooling investment can be amortized over many parts
- Situations requiring consistent dimensional repeatability

## When It May Be a Poor Fit

- Prototyping or very low production volume
- Frequent design changes expected
- Extremely large parts or unusually thick sections
- Designs requiring extensive machining after casting

## Design Implications

- Tooling rules dominate geometry (draft, ejection, parting line)
- Early DFM review reduces tooling iteration risk
- Secondary operations must be planned upfront

## Agent Heuristics

- Proto/small batch + die casting selected → HIGH risk (tooling ROI)
- Geometry implying many side actions → HIGH tooling complexity risk
- Tight tolerance expectations without machining plan → HIGH risk
