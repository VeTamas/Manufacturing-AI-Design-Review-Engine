# Die Casting: Parting Line, Ejection, and Side Actions

Tool direction planning is essential early in design.

## Parting Line Planning

- Avoid cosmetic surfaces near parting lines where possible
- Plan flash trimming accessibility
- Align parting line with natural geometry transitions

## Ejection Considerations

- Provide robust ejector contact surfaces
- Avoid delicate features in ejector load paths
- Plan ejector marks on non-critical surfaces

## Undercuts and Slides

- Undercuts require side actions or lifters
- Each additional slide increases tooling complexity
- Excessive side actions impact reliability and cost

## Agent Heuristics

- Undercut implied without tooling strategy → HIGH risk
- Cosmetic surface + ejector marks unclear → MEDIUM risk
- Critical interface near parting line → HIGH risk
