# Die Casting: Alloy Selection Notes

Material selection affects flow, shrinkage, strength, and finishing.

## Considerations

- Flow characteristics vary by alloy
- Corrosion environment may require coatings
- Mechanical properties depend on alloy and processing

## Design Implications

- Confirm alloy early
- Avoid locking tolerance expectations before material finalization

## Agent Heuristics

- Alloy unspecified + tight requirements → MEDIUM risk
- Corrosive environment without material plan → HIGH risk
