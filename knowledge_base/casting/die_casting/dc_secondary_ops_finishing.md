# Die Casting: Secondary Operations and Finishing

Secondary operations often dominate total cost.

## Typical Operations

- Trimming and deflashing
- Machining datums or fits
- Surface finishing and coating
- Threading or inserts

## Design Implications

- Ensure machining accessibility
- Consider coating thickness effects
- Plan acceptable cosmetic witness marks

## Agent Heuristics

- Tight tolerance + coating without allowance → HIGH risk
- Deburring access limited → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Cosmetic requirements without witness strategy → MEDIUM risk
