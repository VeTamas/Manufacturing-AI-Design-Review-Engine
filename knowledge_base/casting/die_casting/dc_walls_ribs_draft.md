# Die Casting: Walls, Ribs, Fillets, and Draft

Geometry strongly influences fill quality, shrinkage behaviour, and defect risk.

## Wall Thickness Strategy

- Favor uniform wall thickness where possible
- Avoid abrupt thickness transitions
- Use ribs instead of heavy walls for stiffness

## Ribs and Bosses

- Ribs improve stiffness but should not create hot spots
- Bosses are often cored to reduce shrinkage risk

## Fillets

- Internal fillets improve metal flow
- Sharp corners increase crack and porosity risk

## Draft

- Draft supports reliable ejection
- Deeper features or textured surfaces typically require more draft
- Lack of draft increases sticking and surface damage risk

## Agent Heuristics

- Minimal draft on molded surfaces → HIGH risk
- Thick hot spots without coring strategy → HIGH risk
- Sharp internal corners in load regions → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
