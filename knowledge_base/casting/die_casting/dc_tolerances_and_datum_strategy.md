# Die Casting: Tolerances and Datum Strategy

Precision depends on process stability, tooling, and machining strategy.

## Tolerance Reality

- As-cast tolerances are typically looser than machining
- Dimensional stability depends on geometry and cooling conditions

## Datum Strategy

- Define realistic cast datums
- Machine critical interfaces when precision is required
- Provide machining allowance where necessary

## Inspection Considerations

- Identify functional vs cosmetic dimensions
- Avoid tolerance chains across many as-cast features

## Agent Heuristics

- High tolerance criticality without machining plan → HIGH risk
- Precision fits assumed as-cast → HIGH risk
- Many tight dimensions without datums → HIGH risk
