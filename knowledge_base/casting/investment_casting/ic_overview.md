# Investment Casting Overview

Investment casting supports complex geometry with good surface finish.

## Best Use Cases

- Complex shapes difficult to machine
- Moderate production volumes
- Near-net-shape metal parts

## Limitations

- Still requires machining for critical fits
- Cycle times longer than die casting
- Size constraints exist

## Agent Heuristics

- Tight tolerances assumed as-cast → HIGH risk
- Internal channels without inspection plan → HIGH risk
