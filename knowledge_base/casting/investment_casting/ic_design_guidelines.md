# Investment Casting Design Guidelines

## Geometry Guidance

- Smooth transitions preferred
- Avoid abrupt thickness changes
- Fillets reduce defect risk

## Internal Features

- Cavities must allow cleaning/inspection
- Fragile wax features need reinforcement

## Agent Heuristics

- Sharp corners in load areas → HIGH risk
- Internal cavities without cleaning plan → HIGH risk
