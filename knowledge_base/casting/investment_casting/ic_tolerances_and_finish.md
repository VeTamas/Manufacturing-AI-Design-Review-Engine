# Investment Casting: Tolerances and Finish

## Tolerance Reality

- Better surface finish than sand casting
- Precision often requires machining

## Finish Considerations

- Surface quality varies by geometry
- Cosmetic requirements must define critical zones

## Agent Heuristics

- Precision fits assumed as-cast → HIGH risk
- Cosmetic requirements unspecified → MEDIUM risk
