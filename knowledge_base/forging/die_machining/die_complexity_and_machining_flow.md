# Forging Dies: Complexity and Die Machining Workflow (DFM)

Die cost and lead time often dominate the economics of closed-die forging.

## What Drives Die Complexity

- Deep features requiring long-reach machining
- Small radii and sharp transitions (tooling limits + wear)
- Many parting features, undercuts, or side actions (if used)
- High surface finish or tight dimensional repeatability requirements

## Practical Workflow Notes

- Expect iterative die tryouts and tuning.
- Complex geometry increases die machining time and verification effort.

## Agent Heuristics

- Small radii + deep details → HIGH risk (die machining + wear)
- Many unique features / high variety → MEDIUM to HIGH risk (die complexity)
- Tight tolerances without specifying machined surfaces → HIGH risk
