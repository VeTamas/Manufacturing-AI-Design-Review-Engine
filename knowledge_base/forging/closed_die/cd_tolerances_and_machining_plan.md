# Closed-Die Forging: Tolerances and Machining Plan

Forged parts commonly need machining for precision interfaces and to control final GD&T.

## Practical Tolerance Strategy

- Treat forging as a near-net preform.
- Identify which features are:
  - **As-forged** (non-critical)
  - **Machined** (interfaces, seals, bearing fits, precise holes)
- Define datums that can be established reliably during machining.

## Design Notes

- Plan for heat-treat distortion where applicable; consider machining after heat treat for critical surfaces.
- Avoid long tolerance chains across multiple "as-forged" faces.

## Agent Heuristics

- Tight tolerances specified but no machining/datum plan → HIGH risk
- Precision holes/bearing fits expected as-forged → HIGH risk
- GD&T implied in words but no drawing provided → HIGH risk
