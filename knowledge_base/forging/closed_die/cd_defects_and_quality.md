# Closed-Die Forging: Defects and Quality Risks

Forging defects are often geometry- and flow-driven. Designing with flow in mind reduces the probability of scrap or rework.

## Common Risk Patterns (High-Level)

- Laps/folds from poor flow convergence
- Cracks from excessive local strain or sharp transitions
- Underfill in thin/extreme regions (fill difficulty)
- Distortion from thermal gradients and heat treat

## Design Notes

- If a defect in a region would be catastrophic, redesign to reduce flow complexity there.
- Consider inspection strategy appropriate to risk (dimensional checks, surface inspection, NDT where needed).

## Agent Heuristics

- Thin/extreme regions + high mechanical requirements → HIGH risk
- Sharp corners in high-strain regions → HIGH risk
- No inspection strategy for safety-critical forging → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
