# Closed-Die Forging: Radii, Transitions, and Material Flow

Material flow drives forging quality. Radii and smooth transitions reduce local strain concentrations and die wear.

## Radii and Corners

- Prefer generous internal radii; sharp corners resist flow and concentrate strain.
- Avoid sudden steps; introduce smooth tapers or blended transitions.

## Section Changes

- Gradual changes improve fill and reduce risk of laps/folds.
- Keep load paths smooth; avoid geometry that forces abrupt directional changes in flow.

## Design Notes

- If a corner is load-bearing, radii are usually beneficial for both forging and fatigue.
- If a sharp corner is functionally required, consider machining it after forging.

## Agent Heuristics

- Small internal radii in critical regions → HIGH risk
- Abrupt transitions in thick-to-thin sections → HIGH risk
- Deep narrow features with limited flow access → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
