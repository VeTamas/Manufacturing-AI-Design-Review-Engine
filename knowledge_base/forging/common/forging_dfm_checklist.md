# Forging: DFM Checklist (Quick Review)

Use this checklist as a fast "go/no-go" pass before detailed vendor DFM.

## Geometry & Flow

- Smooth transitions between sections
- Generous internal radii; avoid sharp steps
- Avoid isolated mass that can trap strain/heat and create defects
- Avoid thin webs or deep narrow cavities (depends on process)

## Tooling & Parting

- Define parting line concept
- Define draft intent for closed-die shapes
- Avoid undercuts unless there is a clear die strategy
- Ensure ejection/handling surfaces exist

## Tolerances & Machining

- Mark which faces/features are machined
- Define datums that make sense after forging and after heat treat
- Avoid long tolerance stacks on "as-forged" surfaces

## Quality & Risk

- Identify fatigue-critical regions; keep flow smooth there
- Plan inspection approach (visual, dimensional, NDT if needed)
- If defects (laps, folds, cracks) would be catastrophic, tighten design constraints early

## Agent Heuristics

- "As-forged precision fit" expectation → HIGH risk
- Fatigue-critical + sharp corners/abrupt transitions → HIGH risk
- No machining plan for critical interfaces → HIGH risk
- No parting/draft/ejection plan for closed-die → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
