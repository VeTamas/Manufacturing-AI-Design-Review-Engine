# Tooling Design and Tooling Materials (Cost, Heat Transfer, Durability)

Tooling is a primary driver of thermoforming cost, cycle time, and repeatability. Tool material selection depends on volume, desired finish/detail, and thermal performance.

## Key DFM Guidelines

- High volume production: aluminum molds are commonly preferred due to strong thermal conductivity and durability.
- Prototype / short runs: wood and plaster can be used but have limits (durability, heat conduction, temperature control).
- Cast or filled epoxy/plastic tooling:
  - Metal-filled epoxy improves thermal conductivity and can be durable for low/medium volumes.
  - Resin-based tooling can be patched/repaired relatively cheaply.
- Tool heat transfer matters:
  - Mold temperature control influences surface finish, chill marks, and cycle time.

## Tooling Practical Notes

- Wood molds: must be sealed; humidity changes dimensions; poor cooling can lead to heat buildup and process instability.
- Plaster molds: inexpensive and shapeable, but weak and poor for production; surface treatments can improve wear.
- Spray metal shells backed with epoxy/aluminum can replicate excellent detail.

## Limitations / Risks

- Poor thermal management → warpage, chill marks, inconsistent forming.
- Inadequate venting or vacuum distribution → incomplete draw, webbing, surface defects.
- Overly polished tooling may complicate release for some geometries.

## Agent Heuristics

- Volume high + cycle time critical → recommend aluminum tooling.
- Prototype/low volume + large part → wood/resin tooling acceptable with risk notes.
- Need high cosmetic detail without vent marks → consider tooling approaches that reduce vent marking + controlled vacuum distribution.
