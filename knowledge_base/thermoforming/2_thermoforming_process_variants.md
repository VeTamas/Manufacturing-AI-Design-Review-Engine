# Thermoforming Methods and Variants (When to Use Which)

Thermoforming can be single-step (form in one operation) or multiple-step (pre-stretch then final form). Multiple-step methods are used to improve thickness distribution and reduce excessive thinning.

## Key DFM Guidelines

- Single-step techniques:
  - Drape forming (male mold vacuum forming)
  - Straight vacuum forming (female mold)
  - Pressure forming
  - Free forming (no mold contact during forming)
  - Matched-mold forming
  - Trapped-sheet pressure forming
  - Twin-sheet pressure forming
- Multiple-step techniques:
  - Plug-assisted vacuum forming
  - Plug-assisted pressure forming
  - Snap-back forming (vacuum/billow variants)
  - Slip-ring forming

## Practical Selection Notes

- Moderate depth-to-width draws (< ~2:1): male drape can provide more uniform wall than straight female vacuum.
- Very deep draws (> ~2:1): use pre-stretch (billow) and/or plug-assisted female forming for improved distribution.
- If high detail reproduction and better dimensional accuracy are needed: matched-mold forming can approach injection-like detail (tooling cost rises).

## Limitations / Risks

- Each assist method adds tooling complexity, cycle tuning, and potential surface marking (plug marks).
- Snap-back / billow methods reduce webbing and can improve distribution but require more process control.

## Agent Heuristics

- Deep draw + uniform thickness requirement → recommend plug assist / pre-stretch method.
- "Injection-like detail" requirement + moderate volumes → suggest pressure forming or matched molds.
- Two-sided hollow structure / joined halves → consider twin-sheet forming.
