# Cost Drivers and Process Selection (When Thermoforming Wins)

Thermoforming often wins on tooling cost and feasibility for large parts, prototypes, and moderate volumes. It loses when tight tolerances, thick sections with internal detail, or two-side precision are required.

## Key DFM Guidelines

- Advantages:
  - Lower tooling cost compared to injection molds for large parts.
  - Large parts are feasible (size limited mainly by sheet availability).
  - Faster tooling lead times for prototypes/low volumes.
- Cost drivers:
  - Sheet cost higher than raw resin in some cases.
  - Trimming scrap can be substantial; recycling/regrind impacts economics.
  - Cycle time for thick gauge durable parts is longer due to heating/cooling.
- Volume sweet spots:
  - Often effective for prototypes to moderate production, especially for large components.
  - High-speed thin gauge packaging can be extremely high output with multi-cavity tooling.

## Limitations / Risks

- If "close tolerance everywhere" or "two-sided detailed accuracy" is mandatory, thermoforming cost and complexity rise sharply (matched tooling, secondary ops).
- Material waste and trimming can dominate cost if not managed.

## Agent Heuristics

- Large cosmetic cover + moderate annual qty + tooling budget constrained → recommend THERMOFORMING strongly.
- If part is small, thick, and requires bosses/ribs/inserts everywhere → thermoforming likely poor fit; consider IM/CNC.
- If part is deep draw and functional thickness is critical → require multi-step forming / plug assist or warn of risk.
