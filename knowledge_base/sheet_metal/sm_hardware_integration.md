# Sheet Metal: Hardware Integration

Integrating hardware requires early design consideration.

## Common Hardware Types

- PEM nuts and studs
- Clinch fasteners
- Welded inserts

## Design Constraints

- Hardware installation requires tool access
- Minimum edge distances must be respected
- Hardware affects flat pattern and forming order

## Assembly Implications

- Hardware placement affects bend feasibility
- Late-stage hardware changes are costly
- Improper integration causes interference

## Agent Heuristics

- Hardware added without access analysis → HIGH risk
- Hardware too close to bend → HIGH risk
- Hardware defined post-design → MEDIUM risk
