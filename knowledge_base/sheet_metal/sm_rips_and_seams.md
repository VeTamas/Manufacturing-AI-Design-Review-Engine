# Sheet Metal: Rips and Seams

Rips and seams enable unfolding and forming of closed sheet metal shapes.

## Purpose of Rips

- Allow material separation during unfolding
- Enable creation of boxes and enclosures
- Prevent unintended deformation

## Seam Design Considerations

- Seam placement affects strength and appearance
- Seams often require welding or fastening
- Seam accessibility affects assembly cost

## Design Implications

- Poor seam placement increases distortion risk
- Hidden seams complicate joining
- Seam location should align with functional requirements

## Agent Heuristics

- Closed shape without seam strategy → HIGH risk
- Seam placed on cosmetic surface → MEDIUM risk
- Seam inaccessible for joining → HIGH risk
