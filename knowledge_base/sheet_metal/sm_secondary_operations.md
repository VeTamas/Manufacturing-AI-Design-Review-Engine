# Sheet Metal: Secondary Operations

Secondary operations often dominate cost and lead time.

## Typical Secondary Operations

- Tapping
- Machining
- Welding
- Hardware installation
- Surface finishing

## Design Trade-Offs

- Each secondary operation adds setup and handling
- Poor design multiplies secondary steps
- Operations sequence affects distortion

## Cost and Risk

- Late-added operations increase scrap risk
- Tight tolerances amplify operation sensitivity
- Reducing secondary ops improves consistency

## Agent Heuristics

- Multiple secondary operations without justification → HIGH risk
- Precision features relying on secondary ops → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Secondary operations ignored in design → HIGH risk
