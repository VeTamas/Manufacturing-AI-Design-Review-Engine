# Sheet Metal: Surface Finish and Coatings

Surface treatments affect corrosion resistance, appearance,
tolerances, and downstream assembly.

## Common Finishing Methods

- Powder coating
- Plating (zinc, nickel, chrome)
- Anodizing (aluminum)
- Painting
- Brushing and polishing

## Design Implications

- Coatings add thickness and affect tolerances
- Sharp edges lead to uneven coating
- Masking may be required for functional surfaces

## Manufacturing Risks

- Poor edge preparation reduces coating quality
- Tight tolerances may be violated after coating
- Rework after coating is expensive

## Agent Heuristics

- Tight tolerance without coating allowance → HIGH risk
- Sharp edges on coated parts → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Finish specified without process awareness → MEDIUM risk
