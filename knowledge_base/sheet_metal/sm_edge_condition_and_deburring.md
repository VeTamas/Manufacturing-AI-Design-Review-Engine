# Sheet Metal: Edge Condition and Deburring

Edge quality affects safety, assembly, and finish quality.

## Edge Formation

- Laser cutting leaves heat-affected edges
- Punching creates burrs and deformation
- Waterjet produces rougher edges

## Deburring Considerations

- Burrs interfere with assembly
- Sharp edges increase injury risk
- Deburring adds time and cost

## Design Implications

- Edge condition should match functional requirements
- Cosmetic parts require higher edge quality
- Deburring access must be ensured

## Agent Heuristics

- Sharp edges on user-facing parts → HIGH risk
- Deburring not specified → MEDIUM risk
- Inaccessible edges requiring deburring → HIGH risk
