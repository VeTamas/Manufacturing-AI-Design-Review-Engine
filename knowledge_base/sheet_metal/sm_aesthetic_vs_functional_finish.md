# Sheet Metal: Aesthetic vs Functional Finish Requirements

Finish requirements must align with part function and use environment.

## Aesthetic Finishes

- Focus on appearance and uniformity
- Sensitive to scratches and defects
- Increase handling and inspection effort

## Functional Finishes

- Prioritize corrosion resistance or wear
- Appearance secondary
- Often more tolerant of variation

## Design Trade-Offs

- Aesthetic requirements increase cost
- Over-specification drives unnecessary finishing
- Environment should drive finish choice

## Agent Heuristics

- Aesthetic finish on non-visible part → MEDIUM risk
- Finish spec inconsistent with environment → HIGH risk
- No distinction between aesthetic and functional needs → MEDIUM risk
