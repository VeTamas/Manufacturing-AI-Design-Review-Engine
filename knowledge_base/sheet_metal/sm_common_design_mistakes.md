# Sheet Metal: Common Design Mistakes

Many sheet metal failures stem from recurring design oversights.

## Frequent Mistakes

- Ignoring bend radii limits
- Missing bend reliefs
- Designing non-uniform thickness
- Overusing tight tolerances
- Assuming sharp internal corners are achievable

## Manufacturing Impact

- Increased scrap rates
- Additional manual rework
- Unpredictable part deformation

## Design Guidance

- Validate bends early
- Favor simple, repeatable geometry
- Align tolerances with functional needs

## Agent Heuristics

- Multiple known mistake patterns present → HIGH risk
- Tight tolerance applied globally → MEDIUM risk
- Sharp corners at bends → HIGH risk
