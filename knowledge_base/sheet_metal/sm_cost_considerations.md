# Sheet Metal: Cost Considerations

Cost in sheet metal fabrication is driven by material, labor, and process complexity.

## Cost Drivers

- Material type and thickness
- Number of bends and setups
- Secondary operations and finishing

## Cost Reduction Levers

- Standard material thickness
- Consistent bend radii
- Reduced part count

## Design Implications

- Small design changes can significantly affect cost
- Over-specification increases unnecessary expense

## Agent Heuristics

- Non-standard thickness without justification → MEDIUM risk
- Tight tolerance on non-functional feature → MEDIUM risk
- Complex geometry for simple function → HIGH risk
