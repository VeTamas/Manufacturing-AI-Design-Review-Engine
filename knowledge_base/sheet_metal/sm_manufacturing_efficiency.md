# Sheet Metal: Manufacturing Efficiency

Efficient sheet metal design reduces cost, lead time, and variability.

## Efficiency Drivers

- Fewer bends and setups
- Consistent tooling
- Minimal secondary operations

## Design Recommendations

- Combine bends when possible
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Design parts to be self-locating during assembly

## Cost Implications

- Each additional setup increases cost
- Tight tolerances increase inspection effort
- Secondary machining raises lead time

## Agent Heuristics

- High bend count without justification → MEDIUM risk
- Multiple secondary operations → HIGH risk
- Design ignores manufacturing sequence → HIGH risk
