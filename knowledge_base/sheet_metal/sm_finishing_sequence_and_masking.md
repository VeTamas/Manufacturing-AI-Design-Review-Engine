# Sheet Metal: Finishing Sequence and Masking

Finishing order influences quality and dimensional accuracy.

## Finishing Order Considerations

- Bending typically precedes coating
- Machining may occur before or after coating
- Masking protects functional surfaces

## Masking Implications

- Masking adds labor and cost
- Poor masking leads to rework
- Masking strategy must be designed in

## Design Implications

- Features requiring bare metal must be accessible
- Masked surfaces affect coating uniformity
- Finishing order affects tolerance strategy

## Agent Heuristics

- Bare-metal requirement without masking plan → HIGH risk
- Functional surface exposed during coating → HIGH risk
- Finishing sequence undefined → MEDIUM risk
