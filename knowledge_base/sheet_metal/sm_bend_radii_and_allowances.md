# Sheet Metal: Bend Radii and Bend Allowances

Bending introduces geometric constraints that must be respected
for reliable and repeatable manufacturing.

## Bend Radius Fundamentals

- Sharp bends increase cracking and springback risk
- Internal bend radius depends on material and thickness
- Consistent bend radii simplify tooling and reduce cost

## Bend Allowance Awareness

- Flat pattern length depends on bend geometry
- Incorrect bend allowance leads to dimensional errors
- CAD models must reflect realistic bend behavior

## Design Implications

- Inconsistent bend radii increase setup complexity
- Tight bends on thick material increase failure risk
- Ignoring bend allowance affects assembly fit

## Agent Heuristics

- Bend radius smaller than material capability → HIGH risk
- Multiple bend radii in one part → MEDIUM risk
- Flat pattern not considered → HIGH risk
