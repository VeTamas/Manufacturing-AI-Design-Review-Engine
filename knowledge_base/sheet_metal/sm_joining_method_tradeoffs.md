# Sheet Metal: Welding vs Riveting Trade-Offs

Joining method selection affects strength, distortion, and cost.

## Welding Characteristics

- Strong, permanent joints
- Heat distortion risk
- Requires skilled labor

## Riveting and Mechanical Fastening

- Lower heat input
- Easier rework
- Visible fasteners

## Design Trade-Offs

- Welding near precision features increases risk
- Rivets require access on both sides
- Joining method affects tolerance strategy

## Agent Heuristics

- Welding chosen near tight tolerance features → HIGH risk
- Joining method unspecified → MEDIUM risk
- Fastening method conflicts with geometry → HIGH risk
