# Sheet Metal: Material Selection

Material choice strongly affects formability, strength, corrosion resistance,
and manufacturing cost in sheet metal design.

## Common Materials

- Steel: strong, affordable, widely available
- Aluminum: lightweight, corrosion-resistant, good formability
- Stainless steel: corrosion-resistant, harder to form
- Copper and brass: conductive, decorative, higher cost
- Titanium: high strength-to-weight, difficult and costly to form

## Design Implications

- Higher strength materials reduce allowable bend radii
- Corrosion-resistant materials may increase forming difficulty
- Exotic materials increase cost and lead time

## Agent Heuristics

- Material selected without forming consideration → MEDIUM risk
- High-strength material + tight bends → HIGH risk
- Exotic material without justification → MEDIUM risk
