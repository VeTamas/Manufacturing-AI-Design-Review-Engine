# Sheet Metal: Strength and Rigidity Features

Thin sheet metal requires geometric features to achieve stiffness.

## Common Stiffening Features

- Flanges
- Ribs and beads
- Gussets
- Returns and hems

## Design Trade-Offs

- Added features increase forming complexity
- Excessive stiffening increases cost
- Feature placement affects load paths

## Functional Implications

- Flat sheets are prone to vibration and deflection
- Edge flanges significantly improve rigidity
- Symmetry improves load distribution

## Agent Heuristics

- Large flat unsupported areas → HIGH risk
- Structural role without stiffening features → HIGH risk
- Over-stiffened cosmetic parts → MEDIUM risk
