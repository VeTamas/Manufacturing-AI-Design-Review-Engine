# Extrusion Tolerances

Extrusion tolerances are good but generally
inferior to precision machining.

Best tolerances:

- Across solid metal dimensions
- Not across gaps.

Tight tolerances increase cost significantly.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Post-machining common
- Functional interfaces often finished later

## Agent Heuristics

- Tight tolerance requirement → secondary machining needed
- Precision mating part → extrusion alone insufficient
