# Extrusion Die Design

Die system typically includes:

- Die
- Backer plate
- Bolster support

Replaceable inserts improve tool life.

Die quality directly affects:

- Surface finish
- Dimensional accuracy
- Production speed.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Tooling complexity dominates cost
- Wear-resistant inserts extend run length

## Agent Heuristics

- Complex geometry → tooling cost escalation
- High wear alloy → insert tooling recommended
