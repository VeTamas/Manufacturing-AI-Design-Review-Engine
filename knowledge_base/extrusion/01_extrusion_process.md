# Extrusion Process Fundamentals

Extrusion is a manufacturing process where material is forced
through a die to produce a continuous profile with constant
cross-section.

Metal extrusion:

- Heated billet (~450–500°C for aluminum)
- High pressure pressing through die
- Near-net shape structural profiles

Plastic extrusion:

- Melted polymer transported by rotating screw
- Extrudate cooled via calibration system
- Continuous profile production

## Manufacturing Implications

- Excellent for long prismatic parts
- Tooling dominates process capability
- Secondary operations common

## Agent Heuristics

- Constant cross-section → extrusion candidate
- Long CNC-machined prismatic part → extrusion alternative
- Variable geometry part → extrusion mismatch risk
