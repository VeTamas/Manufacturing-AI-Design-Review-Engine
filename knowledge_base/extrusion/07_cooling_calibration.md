# Cooling and Calibration

Extruded profiles require controlled cooling
to stabilize dimensions.

Calibration methods:

- Vacuum calibration
- Pressure calibration
- Water bath cooling

Wall thickness determined by:

- Die gap
- Puller speed.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Cooling uniformity critical
- Hollow profiles require support

## Agent Heuristics

- Uneven cooling → distortion risk
- Large hollow extrusion → vacuum calibration required
