# Extrusion Geometry Design Rules

Uniform wall thickness is critical for stable extrusion.

Non-uniform thickness leads to:

- Uneven cooling
- Residual stress
- Warping

Rounded corners improve metal flow and reduce die stress.

Symmetry reduces distortion risk.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Adjacent wall thickness ratio ideally < 2:1
- Thin flanges prone to distortion
- Smooth transitions recommended

## Agent Heuristics

- Non-uniform wall thickness → HIGH distortion risk
- Sharp internal corners → die wear risk
- Asymmetric profile → bending risk
