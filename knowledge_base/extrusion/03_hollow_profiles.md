# Hollow Profile Extrusion

Hollow profiles are produced using bridge or porthole dies.

Metal flow:

- Split around mandrel
- Pressure welded downstream
- Integral structure maintained

Semihollow shapes defined by tongue ratio.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Higher tooling cost
- Slower extrusion speed
- Design complexity higher

## Agent Heuristics

- Multi-void hollow profile → cost HIGH
- Small internal voids → die break risk
- Solid redesign possible → suggest simplification
