# Extrudability Metrics

Extrusion ratio:

Billet cross-section area /
Extruded profile cross-section area.

Typical optimal range:

~30–60 for aluminum extrusion.

Low ratios:

- Poor material working

High ratios:

- Increased process load.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Press capacity limits geometry
- Shape factor affects feasibility

## Agent Heuristics

- Extreme extrusion ratio → process risk
- Low working ratio → property inconsistency risk
