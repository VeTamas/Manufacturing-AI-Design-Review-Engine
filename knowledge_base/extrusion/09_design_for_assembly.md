# Design for Assembly Using Extrusions

Extrusions allow integration of multiple features:

- Screw bosses
- Channels
- Joining geometry

Benefits:

- Reduced assembly operations
- Improved stiffness
- Lower cost.

Extrusions often replace welded assemblies.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Part consolidation possible
- Reduced joining cost

## Agent Heuristics

- Multi-part assembly → extrusion consolidation candidate
- Machined billet assembly → redesign opportunity
