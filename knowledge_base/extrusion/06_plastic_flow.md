# Plastic Extrusion Flow Physics

Die swell:

Extrudate expands after leaving die due to
viscoelastic relaxation.

Melt fracture:

Occurs at excessive shear rates,
causing surface distortion.

Sharkskin defect:

Surface roughness due to flow instability.

## Manufacturing Implications

- Die geometry compensation required
- Processing window narrow

## Agent Heuristics

- Precision plastic extrusion → die swell compensation needed
- High extrusion rate polymer → melt fracture risk
