# CNC: Manufacturing Standards and Surface Finish

These are common baseline expectations unless otherwise specified on the drawing.

## Default Standards (Typical)

- As-machined surface finish: 125 Ra or better
- Sharp edges are broken and deburred by default
- Critical edges that must remain sharp should be explicitly specified
- Clear/transparent plastics may show swirl marks; bead blasting frosts clear plastics
- Tolerances on compressible materials (foam-like) cannot be guaranteed

## Design Implications

- If a sharp edge is functional (sealing, cutting, alignment), call it out explicitly
- Cosmetic expectations for clear plastics should be discussed early
- Surface finish requirements affect cost and lead time

## Agent Heuristics

- Surface finish requirement tighter than standard without justification → MEDIUM risk
- “Keep edges sharp” not specified on drawing → MEDIUM risk
- Clear plastic + cosmetic expectation + machining marks ignored → MEDIUM risk
