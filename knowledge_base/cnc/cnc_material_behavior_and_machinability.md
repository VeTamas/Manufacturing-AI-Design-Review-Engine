# CNC: Material Behavior and Machinability Differences

Material properties strongly affect machining strategy and risk.

## Hard vs Soft Materials

- Hard materials increase tool wear and cycle time
- Soft materials may deform during clamping
- Brittle materials risk chipping and cracking

## Thermal Effects

- Some materials retain heat, affecting tolerances
- Plastics may melt or smear during cutting

## Design Implications

- Material selection affects achievable tolerances
- Fixturing and cutting strategy must match material behavior
- Switching material late can invalidate machining assumptions

## Agent Heuristics

- Material change without machining reassessment → HIGH risk
- Difficult-to-machine material + tight tolerance → HIGH risk
- Soft material + thin walls → HIGH risk
