# Secondary Operations in MIM

Possible post-processing:

- heat treatment
- machining
- polishing
- coating/finishing

Design goal:

- minimize secondary operations.

## Agent Heuristics

- Designed-for-machining geometry → reconsider MIM
- Cosmetic surface requirement → polishing expected
- Tight tolerance critical features → hybrid manufacturing
