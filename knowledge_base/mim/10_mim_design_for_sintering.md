# Design for Sintering Stability

Key design principles:

- symmetric geometry preferred
- flat support faces improve stability
- avoid large isolated mass sections
- consistent wall thickness critical

Common problems:

- distortion
- cracking
- dimensional drift

## Agent Heuristics

- Asymmetric geometry → warping risk
- Mass concentration → distortion risk
- Tight tolerance part → sintering sensitivity
