# Optimal MIM Part Envelope

Typical ranges:

- weight: ~0.5–50 g common
- dimensions generally <100 mm
- length/width ratio ideally <5
- flat support surfaces beneficial

Geometry constraints:

- avoid isolated heavy masses
- maintain section balance

## Agent Heuristics

- Very large part → casting/forging candidate
- Micro part + high volume → ideal MIM case
- Unsupported geometry → distortion risk
