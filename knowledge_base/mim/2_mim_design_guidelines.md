# MIM Design Guidelines

Key rules:

- maintain uniform wall thickness
- avoid abrupt section transitions
- use fillets instead of sharp internal corners
- symmetrical geometry preferred for sintering stability
- gradual thickness transitions reduce distortion risk

Typical envelope:

- parts generally <75–100 mm
- wall thickness ~0.5–15 mm
- intricate features feasible

## Agent Heuristics

- Non-uniform thickness → distortion risk
- Sharp corners → crack formation risk
- Complex geometry with high volume → strong MIM candidate
