# MIM Process Physics

Critical factors:

- homogeneous powder distribution
- controlled binder removal
- uniform sintering temperature

Shrinkage:

- typically ~15–20%
- mostly isotropic if design balanced

Risk factors:

- mass gradients
- poor debinding pathways
- uneven sintering heating

## Agent Heuristics

- Thick/thin section combination → distortion risk
- Poor venting geometry → debinding crack risk
- Asymmetric mass → sintering warpage risk
