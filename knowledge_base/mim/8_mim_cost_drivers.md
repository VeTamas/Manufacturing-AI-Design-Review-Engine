# MIM Cost Drivers

Primary drivers:

- tooling complexity
- powder cost
- sintering energy
- part mass
- production volume

Economics best when:

- high annual volume
- complex geometry
- machining replaced

## Agent Heuristics

- Low volume + complex tooling → cost penalty
- Many machined features → MIM cost advantage
- Large mass part → powder cost penalty
