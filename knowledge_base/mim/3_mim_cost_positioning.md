# MIM Cost Positioning

Cost structure:

- tooling cost high upfront
- powder material expensive
- low per-part cost at scale

Best use cases:

- high production volume
- complex geometry
- replacement of extensive machining

Comparison:

- CNC: flexible but costly for complex features
- Casting: better for larger/heavier parts

## Agent Heuristics

- Low volume (<5k/year) → tooling cost penalty
- Complex CNC-machined part → MIM candidate
- Large/heavy part → casting preferred
