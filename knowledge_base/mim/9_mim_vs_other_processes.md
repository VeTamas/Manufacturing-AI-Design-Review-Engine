# MIM vs Other Processes

Compared to CNC:

- lower material waste
- better feature scalability

Compared to casting:

- better for small precision parts
- casting better for heavy parts

Compared to additive manufacturing:

- AM good for prototyping
- MIM better for mass production

## Agent Heuristics

- Prototype stage → additive preferred
- Medium complexity + high volume → MIM
- Heavy component → casting/forging
