# MIM Materials

Common materials:

- stainless steels (316L, 17-4PH)
- tool steels
- low alloy steels
- nickel superalloys
- titanium alloys
- copper alloys
- tungsten alloys

Material considerations:

- fine spherical powder preferred
- purity affects final density
- powder cost significantly higher than bulk metal

## Agent Heuristics

- Exotic alloy small part → MIM strong candidate
- Large mass exotic alloy → casting alternative
- High strength + complex geometry → MIM positive
