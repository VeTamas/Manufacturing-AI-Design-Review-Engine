# Tolerances and Surface Finish

Typical capabilities:

- dimensional tolerance ≈ ±0.5%
- surface roughness ~Ra 0.8–1.6 µm

Advantages:

- fine details without machining
- logos/threads/features moldable

## Agent Heuristics

- Ultra-tight tolerances → post-machining needed
- Cosmetic finish requirement → MIM favorable
- Precision mating surfaces → hybrid process
