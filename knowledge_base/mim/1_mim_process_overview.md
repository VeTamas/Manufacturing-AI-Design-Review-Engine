# Metal Injection Molding — Process Overview

Metal Injection Molding (MIM) combines:

- powder metallurgy
- injection molding technology

Core process:

1. Feedstock preparation:
   - fine metal powder (<20 µm typical)
   - polymer binder (~40% volume)
2. Injection molding:
   - "green part" formed oversized (~15–20%)
3. Debinding:
   - binder removal via thermal/chemical/catalytic processes
4. Sintering:
   - densification near melting temperature
   - final shrinkage typically ~15–20%

Advantages:

- complex metal geometries
- near-net shape production
- minimal machining required
- high density metal parts (~95–100%)

## Agent Heuristics

- Small complex metal part + medium/high volume → strong MIM candidate
- Large simple metal part → casting/forging candidate
- Many CNC machining steps → MIM cost advantage
