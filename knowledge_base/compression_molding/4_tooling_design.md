# Tooling Design

Compression molds typically:

- heated platens
- matched metal dies
- venting for air escape.

Tooling cost:

- higher than thermoforming
- often lower than injection molds.

## Agent Heuristics

- Prototype + thermoset → compression viable
- Complex multi-cavity tool → cost increase
