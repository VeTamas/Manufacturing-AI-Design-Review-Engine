# Charge Placement and Flow

Material charge position strongly affects:

- fiber orientation
- void formation
- knit lines
- fill completeness.

Poor charge placement:

- uneven flow
- trapped air
- weak zones.

## Agent Heuristics

- Large flat composite → central charge placement recommended
- Complex ribs/bosses → flow study advisable
- Air traps likely in deep pockets
