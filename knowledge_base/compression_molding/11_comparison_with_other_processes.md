# Compression vs Other Processes

Compared to injection molding:

- lower tooling complexity
- slower cycle.

Compared to thermoforming:

- better thickness control
- higher tooling cost.

Compared to machining:

- less waste
- better fiber properties.

## Agent Heuristics

- Thick thermoset part → compression candidate
- Thin sheet plastic → thermoforming candidate
