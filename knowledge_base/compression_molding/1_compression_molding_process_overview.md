# Compression Molding — Process Overview

Compression molding shapes material by placing a pre-measured
charge into a heated mold cavity and applying pressure until
the material flows, fills the cavity, and cures.

Typical materials:

- thermosets (phenolics, epoxies, polyesters)
- SMC/BMC composites
- rubber/elastomers.

Advantages:

- low scrap compared to machining
- excellent fiber wet-out in composites
- good mechanical strength
- relatively simple tooling.

## Agent Heuristics

- Thermoset + moderate/high volume → compression candidate
- Fiber reinforced panels → strong compression signal
- Rubber seals/gaskets → compression common
