# Materials and Cure Behavior

Thermosets undergo chemical curing:

- irreversible cross-linking
- shrinkage during cure
- heat generation (exothermic reaction).

Fiber-reinforced materials:

- orientation affects strength
- charge placement controls fiber flow.

## Agent Heuristics

- Structural composite + thermoset resin → compression positive
- Tight dimensional tolerance → shrinkage compensation needed
- Cure distortion risk → symmetric design preferred
