# MJF — Tolerances, Surface Finish, Cost Drivers

## Tolerances (practical)
- Often comparable to SLS class: ±0.2 mm typical
- Critical features need:
  - machining
  - tolerance relaxation
  - design-for-adjustment (slots, shims)

## Surface finish
- Matte texture
- Post-process:
  - bead blast
  - dye (common)
  - smoothing processes may shift dimensions

## Cost drivers
- Part volume and mass
- Packing density in build
- Z-height affects throughput
- Post-processing effort (powder removal, dye, finishing)
