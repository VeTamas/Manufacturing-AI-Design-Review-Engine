# MJF — Geometry & Design Rules

## Wall thickness
Practical guidance (depends on part scale):
- Thin walls exist, but risk distortion and poor edge definition
- Prefer ≥ 1.0 mm for functional walls
- For large panels, increase thickness or rib

## Holes and bosses
- Holes can print undersized; plan drilling/reaming if critical
- Bosses: add fillets; avoid tall thin bosses without ribs

## Snap fits
MJF nylon supports flexible features.
Design rules:
- add generous radii at flex roots
- avoid sharp corners

## Assemblies and clearances
- Moving assemblies require clearances (similar class to SLS)
- Provide powder escape routes or motion will seize
