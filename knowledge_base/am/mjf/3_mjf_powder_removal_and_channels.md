# MJF — Powder Removal and Internal Channels

## Powder removal is mandatory DFM
Internal channels, lattices, hollow bodies need:
- escape holes
- adequate diameter clearances for evacuation
- avoid dead-end channels

## Drain hole placement
- Prefer holes at low points relative to expected cleaning orientation
- Multiple holes for complex cavities
- Design holes for plugging later if needed (press-in plug, threaded insert, cap)

## Internal lattices
- Great for weight reduction, but:
  - trap powder
  - complicate inspection
  - may require CT scan if critical
