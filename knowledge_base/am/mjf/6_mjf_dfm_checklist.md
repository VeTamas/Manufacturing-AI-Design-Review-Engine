# MJF — DFM Checklist

- [ ] Identify internal cavities/channels → add escape holes and cleaning plan
- [ ] For assemblies → clearance + powder vents
- [ ] Avoid large thin plates → ribs / symmetry
- [ ] Plan machining of datums/critical holes if needed
- [ ] Decide finishing plan (dye, blast, smoothing)
- [ ] Consider batch repeatability → keep orientation consistent
