# MJF — Failure Modes & Mitigation

## Warping / distortion
Drivers:
- large flat panels
- thick-to-thin transitions
- asymmetric geometry

Mitigation:
- ribs and uniform thickness
- fillets at transitions
- orient to reduce large flat cross-sections

## Powder trapped in cavities
Mitigation:
- add escape holes
- avoid sealed cavities

## Dimensional scatter across batches
Mitigation:
- define critical datums to be machined
- keep build orientation consistent across production
