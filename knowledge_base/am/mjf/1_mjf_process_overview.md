# MJF (Multi Jet Fusion) — Process Overview

MJF is a powder-based fusion process:
- A fusing agent is deposited via inkjet
- Heat fuses regions into solid
- Unfused powder supports the part (no supports needed)

## What MJF is best at
- Functional polymer parts
- Good isotropy vs some AM processes
- Faster builds and good repeatability for batches
- Parts that resemble injection-molded nylon properties more closely than many alternatives

## Key realities
- Powder removal still critical
- Surface is generally smoother than raw SLS but still matte
- Orientation influences mechanical properties and surface
