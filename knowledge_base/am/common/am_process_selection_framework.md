# AM: Process Selection Framework (Prototype → Production)

Additive manufacturing is best used when design complexity, iteration speed,
or customization outweigh traditional manufacturing advantages.

## When AM Fits Best

- Rapid iteration (prototype cycles)
- Complex geometry that is hard/expensive with conventional methods
- Low to medium volumes
- Customization / variant-heavy parts

## When AM May Not Fit

- Very high volumes (unit cost dominates)
- Simple geometry where tooling amortizes quickly
- Tight tolerances and surface finish requirements without post-machining plan

## Key Selection Questions

- Is the part prototype or end-use?
- Is repeatability/certification required?
- What are the tolerance and surface requirements?
- What is the expected volume over product lifetime?

## Agent Heuristics

- Production volume high + geometry simple → HIGH risk of AM being wrong choice
- Tight tolerance + no post-machining → HIGH risk
- AM chosen only because "fast" without volume context → MEDIUM risk
