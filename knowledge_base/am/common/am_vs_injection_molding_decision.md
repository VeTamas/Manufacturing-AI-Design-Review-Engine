# AM vs Injection Molding: When to Switch

AM excels in low-volume and high-iteration contexts, while injection molding
wins at high volumes due to low per-part unit cost after tooling.

## AM Advantages

- No tooling, fast iteration
- Complex geometry and customization
- Short lead time for early production

## Injection Molding Advantages

- Low unit cost at scale
- Repeatability for production volumes
- Better surface finish and tighter consistency (typical)

## Decision Signals

- Volume rising steadily → consider molding
- Part geometry stabilizing (few design changes) → consider tooling
- Cost per part dominates business case → consider molding

## Agent Heuristics

- High expected volume + stable geometry + AM chosen → HIGH risk (cost)
- Many variants + low volume + molding proposed → MEDIUM risk
