# SLA — Tolerances, Accuracy, Surface Finish

## Dimensional accuracy (typical)
SLA can be accurate, but real outcomes depend on:
- resin
- orientation
- feature type (holes vs bosses)
- post-cure strategy

### Practical tolerance guidance
- **General:** ±0.1–0.2 mm for small parts is a common expectation
- **Critical fits:** plan secondary operations (reaming, drilling, sanding, machining inserts)

## Hole accuracy
Holes tend to be less accurate than external dimensions:
- small holes may print undersized
- prefer drilling/reaming critical holes

## Surface finish reality
- Up-facing surfaces are typically the smoothest
- Down-facing surfaces show:
  - support marks
  - "stair stepping"
  - roughness from partial curing and supports

## Cosmetic requirements
If you need show-quality:
- orient cosmetic faces upward
- plan sanding/polish
- allow extra stock on cosmetic surfaces for finishing
