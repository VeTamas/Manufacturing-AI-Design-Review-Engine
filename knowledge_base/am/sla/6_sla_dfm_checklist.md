# SLA — DFM Checklist (Actionable)

- [ ] Identify cosmetic faces → orient upward, keep supports off them
- [ ] Identify datum / mating faces → protect from supports; plan post-finish if needed
- [ ] Avoid large thin flat areas → ribs / thicker wall
- [ ] Add fillets (resin notch sensitivity)
- [ ] Oversize holes → drill/ream critical holes
- [ ] Add drain/vent holes to hollow volumes to avoid cupping
- [ ] Confirm support removal access (no trapped supports)
- [ ] Define post-cure plan and note that it affects dimensions
