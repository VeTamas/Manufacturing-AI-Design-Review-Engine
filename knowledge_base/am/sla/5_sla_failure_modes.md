# SLA — Common Failure Modes & How Design Causes Them

## Warping / distortion
Common causes:
- thin large flat panels
- uneven cross-sections
- aggressive post-cure (temperature / UV dose)

Mitigation:
- ribs
- thicker walls
- break up large flats
- design symmetry to reduce differential shrink

## Fragile features
Causes:
- thin pins/posts
- sharp corners
- long cantilevers

Mitigation:
- thicken
- fillet
- add temporary breakaway supports/frames

## Cracking after cure
Resins can become brittle; stress concentrates at notches.
Mitigation:
- generous fillets
- avoid press fits without compliance
- avoid sharp threads directly in resin (use inserts)
