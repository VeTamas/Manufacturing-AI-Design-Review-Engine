# SLA — Supports & Orientation

## Orientation is a primary DFM lever in SLA
Orientation affects:
- support count and contact marks
- surface finish (especially down-facing surfaces)
- risk of print failure due to suction/peel
- dimensional accuracy (warp during peel + post-cure)

## Support strategy rules of thumb
- Put supports on non-critical/cosmetic faces
- Avoid support contacts on:
  - sealing faces
  - datum surfaces
  - precision mating features

## "Suction cup" / cupping risk
Hollow shapes or concave cavities can trap resin and create suction forces.

### Mitigation
- Add drain/vent holes
- Avoid deep concave cavities facing downward
- Reorient to reduce trapped volume

## Support removal access
If supports are required:
- ensure you can reach them with tools
- avoid internal support forests that cannot be removed
