# SLS — Tolerances, Surface Finish, Cost Drivers

## Tolerances (practical)
SLS is typically less precise than SLA:
- **General expectation:** ±0.2–0.3 mm
- Critical features: plan machining/reaming or tolerance relaxation

## Surface finish
- "Powdery" matte texture
- Post-process options:
  - bead blast
  - dye
  - vapor smoothing (improves appearance, can shift dimensions)

## Cost drivers
- Part volume (material)
- Build packing density
- Build height (z-height)
- Post-processing (powder removal + finishing)
