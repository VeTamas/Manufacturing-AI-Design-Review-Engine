# SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) — Process Overview

SLS is a polymer powder bed fusion process: a laser sinters (fuses) powder layer-by-layer.
Unfused powder supports the part, so **no dedicated supports** are required.

## What SLS is best at
- Complex geometry without supports
- Functional nylon parts
- Assemblies printed in-place (with clearances)
- Lattices, internal channels (with powder removal design)

## Key realities
- Surface finish is granular/rougher than SLA
- Warpage can occur due to thermal gradients
- Powder removal is a critical DFM factor

## Common materials
- Nylon (PA12) is common
- Variants: glass-filled, carbon-filled (changes warpage/stiffness/finish)
