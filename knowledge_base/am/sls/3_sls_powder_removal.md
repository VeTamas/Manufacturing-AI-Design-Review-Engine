# SLS — Powder Removal (Critical DFM Topic)

## Why it matters
Powder supports the part during build, but must be removed afterward.
Powder trapped in cavities:
- adds weight
- blocks motion in assemblies
- can contaminate mating surfaces

## Design rules
- Provide escape holes for any cavity
- Avoid deep narrow channels with no outlet
- Use "powder drain" features:
  - holes placed at low points for orientation
  - multiple holes if geometry is complex

## Assemblies printed in place
- Ensure gaps allow powder to evacuate
- Provide "powder vents" between moving interfaces
