# SLS — Failure Modes & Mitigation

## Warping
Thermal gradients cause warp especially in:
- large flat plates
- asymmetric cross-sections
- thick-to-thin transitions

Mitigation:
- ribs
- uniform thickness
- fillets at transitions
- design symmetry

## Weak thin features
Thin pins/walls can be fragile due to porous surface and micro-notches.
Mitigation:
- thicken features
- add fillets
