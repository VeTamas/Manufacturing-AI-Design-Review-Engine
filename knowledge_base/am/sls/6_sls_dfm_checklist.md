# SLS — DFM Checklist

- [ ] Identify cavities → add powder escape holes
- [ ] If printing assemblies → verify clearance + powder vents
- [ ] Avoid large flat thin plates → ribs / thickness / symmetry
- [ ] Plan machining for critical holes and datums
- [ ] Decide if surface texture is acceptable → plan finishing
- [ ] Consider cost: reduce z-height where possible
