# High-Temperature AM: Thermal Environment Control

Stable thermal conditions are critical for printing high-temperature thermoplastics.

## Chamber Temperature Control

- Heated build chambers reduce thermal gradients
- Chamber temperature near Tg improves layer bonding
- Open-frame printers are unsuitable for high-temp polymers

## Nozzle and Extrusion Stability

- Nozzle temperature must remain stable throughout the build
- Temperature fluctuations cause inconsistent bead geometry
- Excessive temperature increases polymer degradation risk

## Cooling Strategy

- Active cooling must be minimized for high-temp materials
- Rapid cooling increases residual stress and warping
- Controlled cooling improves dimensional stability

## Agent Heuristics

- High-temp polymer + no heated chamber → HIGH risk
- Large part + uncontrolled cooling → HIGH risk
- Print relies on ambient conditions → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
