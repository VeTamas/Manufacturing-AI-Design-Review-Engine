# High-Temperature AM: Warping and Residual Stress

Residual stresses increase significantly with high-temperature thermoplastics.

## Stress Formation

- Large temperature gradients cause internal stress
- Thick sections cool unevenly
- Stress accumulation leads to cracking or delamination

## Geometry Sensitivity

- Large flat surfaces are most warp-prone
- Sudden thickness changes increase stress concentration
- Symmetric designs reduce distortion risk

## Mitigation Strategies

- Elevated chamber temperature
- Gradual cooling
- Geometry segmentation or ribs

## Agent Heuristics

- Large flat part + high-temp polymer → HIGH risk
- Thick-to-thin transitions → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- No warping mitigation strategy → HIGH risk
