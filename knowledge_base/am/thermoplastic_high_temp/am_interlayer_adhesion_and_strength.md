# High-Temperature AM: Interlayer Adhesion and Strength

Interlayer bonding is the dominant strength limitation in FFF-based AM.

## Bonding Mechanisms

- Interlayer diffusion improves when printed near Tg
- Poor bonding leads to brittle, layer-parallel failure
- Strength anisotropy increases with insufficient heat retention

## Load Orientation Sensitivity

- Z-direction tensile loading is most sensitive to bonding quality
- High-temperature materials magnify this sensitivity
- Orientation decisions are more critical than with PLA/ABS

## Design Implications

- Load paths must be aligned with strongest bonding direction
- Safety factors should be increased for Z-loaded features
- Test coupons are recommended for structural use

## Agent Heuristics

- Z-direction load + high-temp polymer → HIGH risk
- Structural claim without bonding validation → HIGH risk
- Orientation ignored in strength assessment → HIGH risk
