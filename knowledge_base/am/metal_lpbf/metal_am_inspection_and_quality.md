# Metal AM: Inspection, Quality, and Certification

Inspection strategy is a key constraint in metal AM production.

## Inspection Challenges

- Internal features are difficult to inspect
- CT scanning is expensive and limited
- Surface roughness complicates measurement

## Quality Assurance Implications

- Certification requires repeatable processes
- Design complexity increases inspection cost
- Traceability may be required for production parts

## Design for Inspectability

- Provide access for measurement tools
- Avoid hidden critical features
- Simplify geometry where possible

## Agent Heuristics

- Hidden critical geometry → HIGH risk
- Certification required + no inspection plan → HIGH risk
- Complex internal features → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
