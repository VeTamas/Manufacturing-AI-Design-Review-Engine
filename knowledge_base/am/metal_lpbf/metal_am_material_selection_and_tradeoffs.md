# Metal AM: Material Selection and Trade-Offs

Material choice in metal AM directly affects strength, cost, and post-processing complexity.

## Powder Characteristics

- Spherical powder morphology improves layer uniformity
- Particle size distribution affects surface finish and resolution
- Material availability varies by alloy

## Mechanical Property Trade-Offs

- Higher strength alloys often require stricter process control
- Heat treatment significantly alters final properties
- As-built properties rarely represent final performance

## Business and Supply Constraints

- Exotic alloys increase cost and lead time
- Material certification may be required for production
- Powder reuse policies affect consistency

## Agent Heuristics

- Material chosen without post-process plan → HIGH risk
- Tight tolerance + exotic alloy → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Strength claims based on as-built data → HIGH risk
