# Injection Molding: Ribs, Bosses, and Reinforcement

Ribs and bosses provide stiffness without increasing wall thickness,
but poor design leads to sink, warpage, and weak weld lines.

## Rib Design Rules

- Rib thickness ≤ 40–60% of nominal wall thickness
- Rib height ≤ 3× wall thickness
- Add fillets at rib bases

## Boss Design Rules

- Avoid solid bosses; core them out
- Boss walls ≤ 60% of nominal wall thickness
- Support bosses with ribs instead of thick walls

## Agent Heuristics

- Rib thickness ≈ wall thickness → HIGH risk
- Tall unsupported ribs → MEDIUM to HIGH risk
- Solid bosses in cosmetic areas → HIGH risk

## Design Notes

- Boss holes should be cored out; substantial core depth relative to boss height helps avoid sink marks
- Boss-to-wall connections benefit from generous radii to reduce stress concentration
- Rib spacing should maintain adequate clearance between ribs to avoid flow restrictions and weld lines
- Bosses for self-tapping screws require adequate wall thickness around the boss; use gussets or ribs for support
