# Injection Molding: Additional DFM Notes

## Gate and Flow Design

- Gate location affects flow pattern and weld lines; place gates to minimize weld line length and position
- Weld lines occur where flow fronts meet; strength is reduced compared to base material; avoid weld lines in high-stress areas
- Gate design considerations vary by material; larger gates can reduce shear heating and improve flow for some materials
- Some materials benefit from specific gate types (tab gates, edge gates) and should avoid pin gates on thick sections

## Venting and Cooling

- Vents are critical for air escape; insufficient venting causes burns, short shots, and surface defects
- Cooling channels should be placed close to thick sections; uniform cooling reduces warpage

## Material-Specific Considerations

- Fiber orientation: glass-filled materials have anisotropic properties; flow direction affects strength and shrinkage
- Weld lines in certain materials are weaker; design to avoid weld lines in critical load areas
- Post-mold operations: some materials can be machined, but require appropriate tooling and cooling to avoid material degradation

## Insert Molding

- Metal inserts can be overmolded but require careful design to avoid stress cracking around inserts

## Agent Heuristics

- Weld line in high-stress area → HIGH risk (strength reduction)
- Insert molding without design consideration → MEDIUM to HIGH risk (stress cracking)
- Insufficient venting (deep features, trapped air) → MEDIUM risk (surface defects)
