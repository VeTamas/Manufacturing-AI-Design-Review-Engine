# Injection Molding: Wall Thickness and Uniformity

Uniform wall thickness is one of the most critical design principles
in injection molding.

## Why It Matters

- Thick sections cool slower and shrink more
- Non-uniform walls cause sink marks, voids, and warpage
- Cycle time is driven by the thickest section

## Design Guidelines

- Maintain uniform wall thickness throughout the part
- Transition thickness gradually (avoid abrupt changes)
- Core out thick regions instead of making solid sections

## Agent Heuristics

- Large thickness variation in part → HIGH risk
- Thick cosmetic surface without coring → HIGH risk
- Local thick section near ribs/bosses → MEDIUM to HIGH risk

## Design Notes

- Typical wall thickness ranges from under 1mm to several millimeters for most thermoplastics; thicker walls increase cycle time and sink risk
- Thickness transitions should be gradual; avoid abrupt changes that exceed roughly 1.5:1 ratio to minimize stress and flow issues
- Core out thick sections to maintain uniform nominal wall; core depth should be substantial relative to total thickness
