# Injection Molding: Draft Angles and Ejection

Draft is required for reliable ejection and surface quality.

## Draft Guidelines

- Minimum draft: 1° per side (2° preferred)
- Textured surfaces require additional draft
- Deeper features require more draft

## Ejection Considerations

- Insufficient draft increases ejection force
- High ejection force causes part distortion and surface damage

## Agent Heuristics

- Zero or near-zero draft on molded surfaces → HIGH risk
- Deep cavity with minimal draft → HIGH risk
- Textured surface without added draft → HIGH risk
- Textured surface with insufficient draft → HIGH risk (ejection damage)

## Design Notes

- Textured surfaces require additional draft beyond baseline; deeper textures need proportionally more draft
- Deep features require increased draft per side to ensure reliable ejection
- Ejection pin marks should be placed on non-cosmetic surfaces; avoid placement near thin sections or ribs
- Side actions and lifters require additional draft on surfaces perpendicular to action direction
