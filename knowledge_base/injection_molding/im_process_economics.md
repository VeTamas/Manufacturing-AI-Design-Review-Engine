# Injection Molding: Volume Economics and Process Fit

Injection molding excels at high volumes but has high upfront tooling cost.

## Economic Reality

- Tooling dominates early cost
- Unit cost drops dramatically with volume
- Design changes after tooling are expensive

## Design Implications

- Best suited for stable designs
- Poor fit for rapid iteration or low volume
- Prototype tooling still expensive

## Agent Heuristics

- Low volume + injection molding chosen → HIGH risk
- Design still changing + hard tooling planned → HIGH risk
- Tool cost not discussed → MEDIUM risk

## Design Notes

- Tooling is typically a major upfront cost, often in the tens of thousands depending on complexity; costs should be amortized over production volume
- Design changes after tooling are expensive; avoid changes after first article approval
- Prototype tooling costs a fraction of production tooling but has shorter life
- Break-even volume varies significantly depending on part complexity and tooling cost
